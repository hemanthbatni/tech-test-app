# Technical Test

The task: As a user of Qantas Wine, I would like to see a carousel of a list of products.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Displays list of products from mock data.

Styling is basic and resposiveness is not addressed.

App has basic store that can be enhanced.

Accessibility need to be improved.
